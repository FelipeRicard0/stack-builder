# Stack Builder

**Stack Builder** is a tool designed to quickly set up a project environment. You choose the stack and desired technologies, and the application generates ready-to-use commands that you can copy and paste into the terminal, speeding up the start of development.

In addition, Stack Builder suggests an organized folder structure, following best practices for each selected stack.
